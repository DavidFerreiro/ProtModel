# *ProtModel*
*ProtModel* is a framework for selecting the best-fitting substitution model of evolution for protein alignments considering both empirical and structuraly constrained substitution models by approximate Bayesian computation. *ProtModel* can be run using the terminal or a graphical users interface in Linux or MacOS siystems or in clusters.
